# discord-event-organizer
Event Organizer is a scheduler for Discord that allows a user to poll other users for their availability and automatically creates events based on the result of the poll.

# How Does It Work?

1. Use the /poll command to customize the event poll with the following parameters:
- Name your event
- Set how many votes a date needs to win
- Set the duration of the poll (in hours)
- Set up to 5 date/time choices

2. Server members react to the poll to indicate their availability.

3. The winning choice of your poll is automatically converted to an event for your discord server. No extra work required!
